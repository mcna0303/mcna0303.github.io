  <p>I believe that coffee is the best beverage, especially for students! It brings me joy, keeps me sane throughout my college classes, and allows me to work at my full potential. I spent many years working in coffee shops as a barista and have very specific opinions on the best kind of coffee! There are so many methods to making coffee and blends to try!</p>
  <p>It's very interesting for me to explore the different ways to make coffee. I prefer espresso, it's rich and full of life. However, drip coffee is much more convenient. You can also use a French Press or a moka pot!</p>

  <p>While the methods to making coffee do differ a lot, the actual blends and treatments of the beans change even more! Depending on where you buy your beans from a similar roast can taste completely differently! Some places will grind the beans for you, like my favourite Ottawa coffee shop, Little Victories, while others prefer to only give you whole beans! Different coffee making methods also require different grinds! Espresso machines need a very fine grind to their beans, while a French Press requires a very coarse grind!</p>

  <p>Another fun thing about making coffee is the feel of the beans! They're smooth and small, and are very interesting to tost and smell! Some places even serve chocolate covered coffee beans to eat with your drink! Specifically, Italian coffee shops tend towards this practice.</p>

  <p>Additionally, different countries have different styles of preparation! Italian cappuccinos tend to be "dryer" which means they have more foam than Western style cappuccinos. In the same vein, Italian lattes tend to be "wetter" in that they have less foam than the Western style of the drink!</p>
