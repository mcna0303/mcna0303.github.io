  <p>I adopted Minerva from the Ottawa Humane Society in 2016! From the very beginning she was very vocal and affectionate! At the time, my roommate and I couldn't go one room away without her following after us and meowing as loud as she could!</p>
  <p>I don't know much about where she came from, only that the Humane Society found her as a stray not long before we adopted her. I personally think that she had to have been owned by someone since she's so friendly and happy to be around people!</p>

  <p>I think that many people can benefit from having a cat! They are very intuitive creatures and really love to take care of their people! Lots of people think that because they aren't as overly affectionate as dogs they don't care. That simply isn't true!</p>
