<p>Cats can be finnicky creatures and it's important to ensure you're taking care of them as best you can! I've compiled a list of the most important Cat Care Rules!</p>

<h1>5 Cat Care Tips</h1>
<h2>1. Choose a high quality wet and dry food!</h2>
<p>Cats need food with a high percentage of protein because they are obligate carnivores! They also need a lot of moisture in their diet, as they're not good at drinking enough water! Giving them a high protein wet and dry food will set them up for success.

<h2>2. Keep their water source away from their food!</h2>
<p>Cats still think and behave as if they were in the wild, so their water must be in a different place than their food! They also really like running water, so a filtered fountain is a good idea!</p>

<h2>3. Brush your cats regularly!</h2>
<p>Even though cats are really good at grooming themselves, it's always good to brush them at least once a week to help them with any dandruff or hard to reach spots!</p>

<h2>4. Play time is a must!</h2>
<p>If you're tired of your cat waking you up every night, then it's time to find out what kinds of toys they like! If you play with a cat, especially one over the age of 3, for about 30 minutes a day they'll be too tired to wake you up at the wee hours of the morning!</p>

<h2>5. Cats need just as much love and attention as dogs do!</h2>
<p>Lots of people think that cats are more independent or need less attention, but that's simply not true! It's not good to leave your cat alone for days at a time, so make sure you have a babysitter if you're going out of town! Cats thrive on routine and don't like it when their humans leave them for too long!</p>
